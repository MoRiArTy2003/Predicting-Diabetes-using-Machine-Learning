# **Predicting Diabetes using Machine Learning**

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes using patient data. The project uses a dataset (`diabetes - diabetes.csv`) and a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) to perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## **About the Project**
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient has diabetes. This project demonstrates:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing data and normalizing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- **Model Training:** Building and evaluating machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## **Dataset**
- **File:** `diabetes - diabetes.csv`
- **Description:** Contains patient health records with features indicative of diabetes. For more details, please refer to the CSV file or accompanying documentation.

## **Installation**
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoRiArTy2003/Predicting-Diabetes-using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Predicting-Diabetes-using-Machine-Learning

## **About the Project**
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient has diabetes. The project demonstrates the full pipeline from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to building and evaluating prediction models. Although this is a beginner-to-intermediate level project, it serves as an excellent starting point for those interested in healthcare analytics and predictive modeling.


## **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## **Install Dependencies:**
The project primarily uses Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries via pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter

## **Usage**
Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
The main project work is contained in main.ipynb. You can start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:
jupyter notebook main.ipynb

## **Explore the Notebook:**
Data Loading & Preprocessing: The notebook begins by importing the dataset and handling missing values or inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summary statistics help in understanding the underlying data.
Model Building & Evaluation: Different machine learning models are applied to predict diabetes. Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
Conclusions: The notebook concludes with findings and recommendations for further improvements.

## **Results**
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning for healthcare predictions. The results section in the notebook discusses model accuracy, precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics. This provides insights into which models perform best on this dataset and highlights the challenges and potential improvements in predicting diabetes.

## **Future Improvements**
Feature Engineering: Experiment with additional feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
Model Tuning: Implement hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to refine the models further.
Advanced Algorithms: Explore more advanced models like ensemble methods or neural networks.
Deployment: Consider packaging the model into a web application or API for real-world use.
